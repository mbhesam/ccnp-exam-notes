in rstp even when root switch was selected, each switch sends bpdu every two
minute. 
rstp was not enabled in edge ports. each switche sends proposal on other hand ports.
then recives aggrement. this process called synchronization. proposal will
be sent in DP port. synchronizatoin dont work on edge port. 
rstp on every port will wait time about 3 bpdu to know type of port(edge or P2P)
so in rstp we dont need portfast & bpdu guard. diameter in stp is 7 so 
max 14 will take to reach bpdu to last switch. so max distinct between root switch 
and last switch is 7 layer. if you want to have more layer you have to change diameter
in root switch. direct and indirect changes times is based on diameter so 
if you change diameter with below command the stp timers will changes.
#spanning-tree vlan 2 root primary diameter 2
we can trace mac on cisco swithces depend on enabling cdp or lldp. 
bpdu guard breaches ---> error disable 
root guard breaches ---> port goes to broken(or inconsistancy) states (it should be enabled in
DP ports in root switch)
if)#spanning-tree guard root
#show spanning-tree inconsistant port
#spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default ---> enable for all ports
if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable/disable
# errdisable recovery cause bpdug
# errdisable recovery interval time-seconds
bpdu filter ---> no bpdu send and recieve
bpdu guard  ---> no bpdu recieve
#spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default ---> enable for all ports
bpdu filter is for seprating stp network (no need in LAN)
if)# spanning-tree bpdufilter enable/disable
if)# spanning-tree guard loop
if superior bpdu was not recieve by RP but link stay up, we get envolved of
loop in this moment we enable loop guard (should be enable in root ports)
it checks why does not recieve bpdu if link is down or we have traffic from 
that.
