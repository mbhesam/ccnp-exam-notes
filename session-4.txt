#ip cef distributed ---> switches which are stackable or modular 
#ip cef   ---> centrelized cef enable 
in every line cards we have to insatll DFC in line cards and supervisor engine
should have MSFC 
combo ports in devices are used for two option fiber or ethernet that 
you can use just one of them
Distributed cef can forward traffic between every linecards without engage 
supervisor engine. but in centeralized cef each traffic between line cards 
should go through supervisor engine and MSFC.
SSO is redundancy feature that allows two sup engine (RP(Route Processor))
negotiate for active and passive candidate
supervisor ENgine redundancy mode ---> RPR ---> 2 min down time
				  ---> RPR+ ---> 30 sec down time
				  ---> SSO ---> 1 sec down time
even with sso routing table will lost if active sup crashes. dynamic routing
protocol should have feature called NSF(None Stop Forwarding) for integrating 
with SSO featuer. when master sup goes down, interfaces will shut down and this
makes all neighbour ship will lose immidatly. so if you enable NSF neighbourship
will remain. 
dont forget NSF is just used in modular Switches which both two sup engine 
if link of one routing neighbourship goes down all neighbourship lose immidatley. 
both of routers in neighbourship should support NSF.
