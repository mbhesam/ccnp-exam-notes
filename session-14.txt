when one of routers flaps, the link goes up & down so network of that link 
will transmit and drop immidately and transmit and drop and again and again 
and it will have pressure on all routers cpu therefor to prevent this problem
you have to advertise summary route and it is one of benefits of multi area 
ospf networks. 
ospf does not calculate metric and costs by ospf hello message. it will use
LSA type 1 to calculate this.
