VPN: outer packet ---> transport packet  innner packet ----> passenger packet
ethernet version of now : 2 
L7,L6,L5 ----> data
L4 ----> segment
L3 ----> packet
L2 ----> frame
ethernet header: 
preamble | SFD | dst.mac | src.mac | dot1q | ether.type | payload | trailer
payload -->46-1500(size of mtu can be increased by 9216 called jumbo frame)
trailer ---> 4 
dot1q ---> 4 
type ---> 2 
src and dst mac ---> 6 
preamble ---> 56 bit 
SFD ---> 8 bit 
ethernet header size : 18 with dot1q and without it 14 
so all of packet with max payload and headers is 1522 
preamble----> 1010101... ---> case to know start of ethernet header and 
end of last frame because size of frames are diffrent from each other when
comming through switch 
SFD (start frame delimeter) ----> 101010111 --> case to know start of ethernet header and 
end of last frame because size of frames are diffrent from each other when
comming through switch 
L2 error detection algorithm ----> CRC and FCS  
changing signals to frame encoding and reverses named as decoding
IP header ---> 20 without ip option 
MTU ---> 1500 ( 1460 data + 20 ip header + 20 tcp header)
tcp ptrotocol segment data based on MSS (1460) and deliver to ip protocol 
if packet was upper than MTU , IP should do fragmentation and make DF header
1 that means data is fragmented so other routers doesnot send fragmented 
packets because it is security risks . some hackers fragmente malwares for
not to be blocked by firewalls.  
vlan ranges: 0-4096(2^12)
protocol IDs(ip types): 
	tcp=6,udp=17,icmp=1,igmp=2,GRE=47,ospf=89,eigrp=88 
dot1q:  ---> 2B ---> TPID (tag protocol ID)---> case to undrestand if there is tag 
		(TPID ---> 0x8100 if there is dot1q tag) 
        ---> 2B --->TCI (Tag Control information) ---> 12 bit for vlan ID 
			+ 3 bit pcp(tag for L2 qos named as COS (IEEE 802.1p))
			+ 1 bit DEI (not for ethernet its for congestion dropping)
ethernet type (for calling destination protocol) ---> 2 ---> ipv4 ---> 0x0800
			  ipv6 ---> 0x0806
some times it didnot deliver to upper layer,it delivers 
to protocols in same layer like lldp , cdp , pagp
