if ip undrestand the dst ip is not in network, call arp protocol to get the 
mac address of gateway (not get mac of dst machine).
protocols in control plane have duty to prepare introduction for forwarding.
switches learn mac address table based on dataplane traffics. 
switch aging time is default 5 min.
protocols like eigrp and ospf doesnot work with data at all but some others
like bgp,vxlan,fabricpath work in dataplane & control plane. 
CEF is protocol for Dataplane traffics(DP) not for management Plane(MP)
or control plane(CP).
CEF is hardware routing that take proccess from cpu.
CEF is just for router not for switch. in switch based on CAM table hardware
switching is done. so L2 forwarding does not engage CPU processing and the 
performance of switching increase. it means CAM table has own processor. 
it has ASEC/NPU(Network Processor Unite).
vlan 0 is for qos.
